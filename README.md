Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will write a program that will house many internal
functions. Instead of typing everything within main(), you will create functions
with different responsibilities to start ”fracturing” your code. Fracture, in this
case, is not meant to be a negative term. Think of it like this, when there’s
a fracture in something, one must understand how it came to be, isolate said
problem, and work on it without the bias of external factors.
All requirements below will assume a shape of a circle for all calculations.
For those eager to pursue Software engineering (or SWE for short), you will
learn to construct programs that does not overwhelm itself. There’s a rule of
thumb that says 50 lines per function (no more than that) but there’s an even
better way of describing this:
• Avoid giving a function anxiety for all the stuff it has to do. Or in other
words, DRY.
DRY stands for ”Don’t Repeat Yourself” and is meant to minimize redundancy
by ensuring that any piece of knowledge or logic is represented in a single,
unambiguous place within the system.
If you do end up pursuing a career in SWE, you must be able to process technical
documentation and work with new environments or languages. This will be
essential to your career and this assignment will provide you with an exercise
in doing just that.
